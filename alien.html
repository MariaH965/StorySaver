                    Helia Summers, jr. project manager at mega-company Meritus Design Solutions, MDS Corp. it was better known as, resisted the desire to violently bang her head against the keyboard. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    The light from her laptop strained her eyes, the first rays of dawn creeping into her downtrodden New York closet exacerbated that. She groaned. 
                    <br>
                    <em>
                    " Good Morning,
                    
                    We need another revision on the Harper Project, attached are their requests.*
                    
                    Thanks,
                    
                    Kali " </em>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    “They should do the damn thing themselves then,” she muttered to herself. This had been the fourth overhaul of the high-tech, eco-friendly, super building in the past month. The entire team had been worked to the bone trying to pump out something satisfactory for the curmudgeons at Rixe & Co, a start-up that had hit it big not long ago with their advancements in Virtual Reality. They wanted a building designed ‘for the future’, an amorphous requirement from their board that had her and her team drafting everything from 50’s space age to minimalist and ultra sleek. She looked off to her side, where a copy of the architects most recent draft hung from her cork board and fell to a pile of blue on her floor. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    The project manager, the ‘senior’ who was supposed to be mentoring her, had gone deathly silent pretty early on in the project. So everything had been left to Jamie with absolutely no warning, she had only just graduated with her MBA two years ago. When Paul, her senior, had gone AWOL, she had gotten a meeting with overhead and was reassured that another, experienced, member of the project management team would be assigned to her. They hadn’t and six months later, two projects, with this one making the third, she had become the deFacto leader of her group.
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    And still no raise. 

                    <br>
                    
                    She sighed, her head sagged onto her fluffy pink desk mat, the synthetic fur tickling her nose as she rubbed her face into it. She picked at it, twisting it between her fingers, masterfully procrasinating on her work with nothing at all. Her eyelids slid further and further shut as something like sleep came over her weary head. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    It was a surprisingly restful few hours. 

                    <br>
                    
                    Until it wasn’t 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Her phone alarm let out a god awful noise, a mix of a tortured artist and a cat being harassed, then another, this time from the alarm clock across the room that sang like screeching tires, and finally from her kitchen, where the fancy fridge her boyfriend, James Rollins Jr., had encouraged her to buy sat, it let out a jaunty tune that made her want to gnash her teeth. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    She scrambled to shut everything off as banging came from all directions, her neighbors yelling profanities. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Silence fell once more over her humble abode. Helia, now completely awake, her brown eyes completely bloodshot, went to prepare for work with heavy, reluctant, steps.

                    <br>
                    A half hour later, she was pushing back against the tide of people to the doors of the high-rise. An enormous needle that plunged into the sky. The inside was tastefully decorated, champagne lighting glowed from underneath the extensive solid white marble that lined the walls, the rest was a wash of hardwood, for a bit of a ‘natural’ touch. Sculptures were scattered across the space, some reached toward the high ceilings with their spears, or yearned for the floor, having been hung from the ceiling at odd angles. She swiped herself in and made a bee line for the elevators. 
                    <br>
                    It didn’t take long to be called after settling behind her desk on the 30th floor, her notifications buzzing incessantly. Her first visitor of the day leaned against her desk, Graham, a graphic designer two years her junior, found it fun to bother her any chance she got. It didn’t help that the whole office space was annoyingly open concept. 
                    <br>
                    “Morning!” She chirped, sipping at her coffee from a bright yellow, smiling mug that pained her eyes. Helia almost let out a groan, *almost.* 
                    <br>
                    “Another one?” Graham continued sympathetically, her long pink nails tapped away at the sides of her mug. Helia didn’t even have to open her mouth, the whole office already knew about the hellish process that their team was going through with Rixe. It become a bit of a game at some point for her co-workers, putting in bets to when the next dreaded email would make it’s way to the team’s inbox, always wanting to tack on something new, or erase whole parts of the design. 
                    <br>
                    Graham had made a lot of money with these bets. 
                    <br>
                    The Chanel bag that peeked from under her desk was a testament to it. 
                    <br>
                    “It’s a work in progress,” Helia replied blandly, taking bits and bobs out of her tote bag and placing them neatly onto the desk. She straightened the pen with the tip of her finger. Perfect.
                    <br>
                    “Don’t be like that,” the other woman said, a smile hung from her painted lips, “It must be so~ hard for you,” she stretched out her words, eyes glued onto Helia’s desktop, as if the lock screen would give her the answers she so desperately desired. 
                    <br>
                    “I just want to help, see how you’re doing—y’know…emotionally.” 
                    <br>
                    “Does your help have anything to do with the betting pool in the 27th floor?” 
                    <br>
                    “…” Graham’s eyes rolled to the windows as she took another sip of coffee, “…no” 
                    <br>
                    They really thought Helia wouldn’t know about it. How insulting. 
                    <br>
                    They didn’t even let her participate. 
                    <br>
                    She turned to her desk, tacitly dismissing her coworker with a few loud clicks of her mouse. 
                    <br>
                    “I have to finish drafting that proposal anyway, see you later Helia,” Graham responded in kind, slipping away from her desk with her offensively bright cup in hand. 
                    <br>
                    “Mmmhmm,” Helia tapped away at her keyboard, opening and closing emails endlessly, messaging her team members on the internal messaging board, interspersed with the occasional game of online chess. She wasn’t very good, nor did she like it really, but her boyfriend loved it, it would be nice to play together when she managed to become decent.
