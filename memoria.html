                    On the 24th of December, 2030 on a night with no stars, she dreamt. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Scenes flitted by her. Her wedding to a man she barely knew, her family, her sisters and brothers with their banter and gripes, friends, laughter and petty fights, and when she tried to reach out to grasp them, her memories, they disappeared.
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Then she woke up. 
                    <br>
                    
                    And *knows* that she knew nothing. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    She flexed her limbs, her fingers, blinked and breathed, looked at her surroundings that grew brighter with the burgeoning dawn. Outside, the glare of the sun off freshly fallen snow, the branches of bare trees clawing at the skies, rows and rows of homes with identical roofs in varying colors. Inside, the scent of a gingerbread candle burnt out on the vanity, wisps of smoke still twisting in the still air. The texture of the knit blanket and the clothes she wore, rubbing against her skin. Her eyes grew wide and wide as everything came at her senses all at once, and despite not knowing why, she opened her mouth and screamed. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    January 1st, B.E. 2031*
                    <br>
                    “He wants you,” Jamie whispered, far too close to Samira Zafar’s ear. Her eyebrows wriggled suggestively, “you should go for it.” 
                    <br>
                    Samira, frustrated, ignored her. She clicked away at her keyboard and replied to the umpteenth email of the day. Jamie poked her side, glancing obviously at the man leaning by the communal coffee machine, a steaming cup in hand, he stared in her general direction. Jamie poked her again. 
                    <br>
                    “No.” Samira stated finally, hitting the enter button with more force then necessary. She turned her ergonomic chair to face her nosy co-worker / something like a friend and leveled a stern look at the red-haired woman, who reeled back with an annoyed look. 
                    <br>
                    “I’m just trying to help Sam!” Jamie complained, loudly at first, before lowering her voice, finally realizing they were in an office. “I mean, ever since Malik—” 
                    <br>
                    “Jamie,” she snipped. 
                    <br>
                    “…Sorry.” 
                    <br>
                    A few minutes of silence, then again. 
                    <br>
                    “But seriously—When are you going to get over-” She began again, gesticulating, coffee guy forgotten.“I’m clocking out.” Samira stated, standing up, not deigning to glance at a now floundering Jamie. 
                    <br>
                    “This early? Hey, Sami, wait did you talk to John about this? You could get written up,” Jamie’s voice blended with the low grade humming of the office, the cars honking from the ground below, and the continuous stream of chatter that coated the insides of the Rivet Corporation flagship building. Samira walked, tote in hand, swinging furiously from her side, bouncing up and down as she climbed down the stairs from the 20th floor to clear her head, and to not risk encounter with others, to clear her head.<br>
                    Samira lived alone. 
                    <br>
                    She took the regional train from Manhattan to Long Island, and got off on the stop closest to her favorite bakery, she followed her heart and picked up a chocolate croissant as large as her head, drizzled with caramel, flaking in her hand. She took a bite, relishing in the rich taste as she walked through the bustling town. In the back of her mind, she worries about her job. Samira really thought she would be able to tough it out today, taking the time to go through her usually complex routine, waking up early, going to the gym
