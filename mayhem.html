                    Mayhem - Chapter 1 
                </h1>

                
               <p> 
                
                You are the only child of a humble butler, who is a trusted servant of the venerable house Macy. The Duchy of Macy, is a land bordered by the Wastrel Seas to the east and the Jardine Conservative, a large forest, but a small independent state of druids and mercenaries to the west. It is a prosperous land that spearheads the study of Magitech, is known for it's illustrious acadamy that raises many a genius, and a top producer of high quality Magic Knights and grapes, boasting of vineyards that produced the finest wines. But such great wealth came with enormous responsability, the Duchy is tasked with defending the Elysian Empire from pirates, sea monsters, and other undesirables with their power. 
            
               </p>
               
               <p>

                
                
                Macy, as one of the four founding families, along with Laparis, Varia, and Calladium, stand as a pillar to the empire of Elysia. The Duke having both the ear and heart of the current King, who hailed from Varia, and the Queen, from Laparis. Such a duchy has great pride embedded in it's very bones.

                You led your life in service to Macy and look forward to the day you would take your fathers place as the Head of Affairs. Spending your days running around the property situated in the center of the Duchy, as an aid to the heir, Lyonis Aurelis Macy, who you'd also been a playmate to since young. The Castle Ion, their ancestral home, had been your place of residence since the tender age of five, when your father had taken up his post as a butler after returning from the war he'd been drafted to with the //Hua Successive//,  more formally known as the Dragon's Unity, a country that lay across the sea ruled by a conglomerate of 6 princes and 6 princesses. He'd quickly risen through the ranks and won his place as the head of affairs when you'd turned ten. Your mother wasn't in the picture and you hesitated to ask your father about it, his expressive face turned to stone when you did.

             </p>
             
             <p> 
                You wish you could sweep your hand over your face, but if you did, everything in your arms would fall, you're exasperated.
             </p>
             
             <p>
                 A massive pile of papers, on top of it a tablet, atop that a box of blue pens and beside that, a rapidly cooling cup of coffee that contained so much creamer that the rim of the cup, when sitting atop the papers nearly made contact with your nostrils. It smelled so strongly that it reminded you of the dairy farms in the western region. You wrinkle your nose, half stumbling, half jogging toward the office on the fourth floor, wondering why your father even drank coffee if he was willing to desecrate it's good name in such a heinous way.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Rider Serapin, your father, loves the way you make it, you couldn't fathom why. He especially liked it with heaps of sugar, and likes it best when you brought it to him with your many complaints. He grins, spotting you struggling through the heavy doors from beside the hunched over Duke, who glances at your laden form with some pity from behind his gold rimmed glasses. Rider waves you over, plucking the cup from atop the papers, and handing the tablet to the Duke. He takes a sip and nods, satisfied.
            </p>    
            
            <p>
                The Duke, Orion, swipes through the files on the tablet, the same files piled up in your arms. You hold back an annoyed grunt and place the papers onto a smaller desk off to the side, Lyons desk, who would soon arrive from his morning training to slave over. The Duke looks over to the papers on the desk, and smirks.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Lyon will have to work late," the duke says to your father. Rider holds his chin, glancing over your head with a contemplative look, as if he is pondering the state of the world, "Indeed your grace."
            </p>
            
            <p>

            You roll your eyes, your gaze settles on the ornate molding that trims the room, opting to look anywhere but the farce your father and his grace were playing out. If Lyon was this busy, you were more so as his not so unofficial, official attendant.
            
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The two are reabsorbed in their work as you wait for Lyon, murmuring between themselves. You are organizing the paperwork into somewhat manageable piles as they do, order a maid to bring fresh tea, and set up the workstation.
            </p>    
            
            <p>
                "The King--"
            </p>    
            
            <p>

            You perk your ears, you know it's rude to listen in, but matter concerning royalty was always a great concern of...everyone really.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Their conversation revolved around the Festival of Heroes, the day of which, a banquet would be held in the palace for the nobility to attend. It was an annual festival, but a banquet held by the royal family was a rarity. The King was notoriously wary of allowing anyone into the palace, a precaution, a necessary one, in consideration of the circumstances he assumed the throne under.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The door creaks open, Lyon walks in, his mood quickly sours at the sight of the stack. He's scowling, pushing his golden hair back, sighs, and looks over to his father with exasperation.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Really?"
            </p>    
            
            <p>
                The Duke clears his throat, "It's a rite of passage."
            </p>    
            
            <p>
                Lyon would be baptized in ink today, the Jardine had sent over an enormous proposal regarding a collabaration between the knights and their mercenaries in exterminating a swarm of Trebas, a hive mind type monster, that awakened and propagated furiously every spring. It seems the case was especially bad if they were asking for aid. The Duke had him making some fairly big decisions as of late, especially in matters concerning the knights.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "It's a waste of paper," he replied with a defeated look. He settles behind the desk, grabbing the pen you offer him a tad aggressively. You both share a sullen look as he opens up the first file, another petition to oust the current head of the academy from his position from an annoying vassal that had a personal grudge against him.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                "He's managed another signature," you murmur as it's handed to you. Lyon has marked it for the burner. The Academy Head, Terrance Fior, with too many middle names, was the youngest son of an Earl, an Earl that served as a Calladium vassal. But he was a savant in terms of Magitech development and Macy tried it's best to foster a meritocracy in it's academy. His youth, and his association with another duchy, made his appointment one that rubbed many vassals in the wrong way. You would have to write him a politely worded rejection later, in Lyon's handwriting of course.

            </p>
            
            <p> 
                It's long past noon, your both exhausted. The tips of your fingers are stained in ink and some blood, you thought you'd developed enough callouses to deter such paper cuts but apparently not. Lyon had managed half the stack, but he appears to be defeated.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The door opens again, it's the duchess, Priscilla. The duke beckons her to him, but she rushes toward Lyon with a worried look.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Look what you've done Ori! He looks like he's drowning," she spits, glaring at her husband, she musses Lyon's hair and he looks more a mess than before.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "If it wasn't for [y/n] here, he'd be dead!" She's still messing with his hair. You smile and murmur a quick, "it's nothing, your grace," but she's already moving onto chattering at the duke. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                "Don't be dramatic, the boy is fine, I did this and more in my day,” he replies, he hands something to your father, who looks all too amused. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
                “You, in your day, were the most austere, dour, and boring fogey i’d ever seen in my life, I don’t want my son to turn into that,” she replies haughtily. Lyon’s hair is a rats nest under his mothers ministrations, obscuring his golden eyes. 
                
                <br>

                “Yes, yes, you are the light of my life, where would I be without you,” he says, a smile playing at his lips. 
                <br>
                “Alone,” she states drily, she waves her hand and addresses your father, “will you be attending the banquet with Ori this year, Rider?” 
                <br>
                Your father attended everything with the Duke, it was a matter of course that he would. To your surprise he rejected it with a shake of his head, the duke interceding for him. 
                <br>
                “We think that Lyon and [Y/N] should be attending in our stead this time, Priscilla.” 
                <br>
                Silence. 
                <br>
                “What?” Lyon asks incredulous, he sweeps his hair back into place, his mother is equally shocked her hands hanging in the air. 
                <br>
                You blink, in the midst of processing the duke’s words, you look to your father for confirmation, but he’s staring into space with a grim look. 
                <br>
                The duke clears his throat, avoiding his wife’s gaze, “I have received a missive from the King, I have been excused from attending and instead he asks me to investigate a personal matter of his.” 
                <br>
                “A personal matter?” Priscilla asks, all too quietly. 
                <br>
                The duke sighs, “yes, Rider and I, along with ten knights will be departing for Karsis the day of the banquet.” 
                <br>
                “For how long?” Lyon asks, he stands up, arms crossed, him and his mother had never looked more similar, 
                “Why you? You’re basically retired, especially with your condition? The King should know better than to send you to such a desolate, decrepit, god forsaken end of Elysia!” 
                <br>
                “Lyon—" He begins, he swiped his hand down his face. 
                <br>
                “For a personal matter?” The duchess repeats.
                <br>
                The duke glances at her, sighs, then straightens. 
                <br>
                “I’ll discuss this with you later, Priscy,” He says, trying to diffuse the duchesses temper. 
                <br>
                “I don’t want to discuss this later, Orion.”
                <br>
                “I—”
                &nbsp 
                <br>
                “Your Grace,” your father speaks up, he adjusts his collar with a practiced smile. 
                &nbsp
                <br>
                “We think that it’s time for the ducal prince and my own child to wet their feet and enter the wider world, such events will be their place in the future after all,” your impressed with how he got that out in one piece, the duchesses brow eases, but she’s still glaring at her husband.
                &nbsp 
                <br>
                “You wanted something like this, right?” The Duke adds, a wan smile on his lips.
                &nbsp 
                <br>
                “Not under such circumstances,” she replies, stern. She turns to your father, “My husband doesn’t need a mouthpiece,” your father bows his head, she leaves the room quickly, the door slams shut behind her. 
                <br>
                You cough into your fist. 
                <br>
                “What personal matters,” 
                <br>
                The duke sighs, “You sound like your mother.” 
                <br>
                “Naturally. On what grounds is the king sending you off to Karsis?” He asks. 
                <br>
                “Personal ones.”
               </p>
