                    Karina, who had just moved to the idyllic town of ThistleBrook was already…completely bored with it. But her husband, who she’d met through her mother, claimed it to be the perfect place for new beginnings so…why not? Someone who never really cared too much about their own happenings, she barely knows her husband, who seems nervous to be around her some days. An author by trade she finds her creative juices stunted by the town’s laid-back atmosphere. 
                    <br>
                    So when she meet Laurence Farrow at the local cafe, she finds him that those once blocked inspiration is raging. 
                    <br>
                    She continues to write, slowly growing more obsessed with the romance in the book, she finds parallels between her husband and Laurence, the renovated manor atop the hill and the shed at poppy creek, the group of friends that she swears she can see shadows of, like memory and the secrets of ThistleBrook. There is a supernatural element. 
                    <br>
                    In a quaint house under Half-Hollow Hill, Karina Zafar dreams. 
                    <br>
                    Four children stand shoulder to shoulder the whites of their eyes beyond their small faces with wonder as they admire a full moon overhead, so enraptured, that her attempts to catch their attention falls flat. 
                    <br>
                    But Karina loathed begging, so she waits.
                    <br>
                    Then she awakens. 
                    <br>
                    Her mirror is uncovered, she notices. She gets up to replace the old yellow sheets she’d placed over it, she looks out the window at the thin sheet of light at the horizon and heads to pray. She glances at the bed, at her new husband, Darius, who curls around the pillow barrier she’d set, his soft exhales are the only sound. He doesn’t snore, she thought, pulling on the ubaya, good. It was day two of cohabitation and Karina was testing the waters. She glanced at her phone for the time and shook him awake. He woke, with a start, his features momentarily distorted before smoothing into place once his conciousness set in. 
                    <br>
                    ‘Fajr,’ she whispered, she didn’’t need to, no one else lived with them in this new construction in the heart of Thistlebrook, NY. A red brick cottage dotted with large windows that would’ve flooded the home with natural light, if it wasn’t for the houses positioning by the hill, which allowed the various phases of the sun throughout the day to be seen from a few angles, but guarded against it’s rays.
                    Darius unfurled from the barrier, tripling in size. He towered over Karina at 6’4, he had been in the army at some point as something or another, according to her mothers sales pitch, she hadn’t really retained anything from that conversation. He rubbed his eyes as he stumbled into the bathroom where she heard something fall over. 
                    <br>
                    His curly head popped back out the door, apologetic.
                    <br>
                    “Sorry—” 
                    <br>
                    “It’s fine…was it the—” 
                    <br>
                    He winced, “hairdryer.” 
                    <br>
                    Karina hummed laying out the prayer mats, one in front the other “Another Target run it is.”
                    <br>
                    “I’ll take you this time,” He responded, a half yell, half hushed, muffled by the half-closed door and the sound of running water. 
                    <br>
                    She didn’t respond. Her new husband had broken five small appliances already, from the time after their wedding ceremony, or Nikkah, till now. The first one had been her panini press, which curiously found an extra set of hand-guides at it’s sides, the metal concave. 
                    <br>
                    Thankfully her new husband seemed to be well-off. Another panini press in the place of the old one by the next hour, no explanation ensued, just a nervous silence, followed by quiet apology. 
                    <br>
                    She hadn’t found it in herself to be angry. So she nodded along and let it go.
