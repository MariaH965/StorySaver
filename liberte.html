                    <em> On the seventh day of spring, the lady fancied a ring 
                    <br>
                    The seventh day of summer, there would be no other 
                    <br>
                    the seventh morning of fall, under the witch’s thrall
                    <br>
                    the seventh night of winter, a bed for sinners. </em>
                    
                    <br>
                    It was a stupid little poem that bounced around in Anne’s mind, something the children down the way liked to sing while throwing pebbles they’d found at one another. A poem about the death of a count who’d fallen for a seductress, an event that took place not too long ago, far up north. But despite the geographic hurdles, come it did, the sordid tale and it’s accompanying cutesy rhyme had spread as fast as it could from it‘s origins like a plague. 
                    <br>
                    “She’ll be held for trial.” 
                    <br>
                    “She ripped his fingers off one by one.” 
                    <br>
                    “Heavens!” 
                    <br>
                    Anne listened to the maids and horsemen gossip as she gathered the last of the things on her list. The sick young master she’d been hired to care for was unable to eat much past porridge but he demanded variety, so she’d gotten quite creative these days. 
                    <br>
                    “I heard she boiled his head into soup, then twisted his hair into a doll to practice black magic.
                    <br>
                    “Count Kellers was a good man, he’d brought her in from the rain, but then…”
                    <br>
                    “And that’s how she repaid him…”
                    <br>
                    The florist too, had some things to say about the debacle, his eyes rolling back and forth between her and his assistant. She nodded along, intent on keeping the pile of fresh flowers from falling into disarray as they babbled at her. The young master rarely went out, so she was tasked with brightening the usually dark room with plants to cheer him up. Anne didn’t think the man liked them much, but she followed the stewards orders nonetheless. She adjusted the hefty basket as she set off to the next store to procure more candles, it was astounding how quickly such a small household could use up a king’s ransom worth of them.
