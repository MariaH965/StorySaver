                    Fiza - Chapter 1 
                </h1>

                <p class="fiza-fi">
                    Once Upon a Time, there was a mountain range that stretched across the world. The wind blowing past would pick up songs and calls of all kinds scattering them to the four corners of the earth dutifully. And those who heeded the mountains faithful herald were always the most adventurous, the most spiritual, the most arrogant, the most prideful, and the most envious; only inviting creatures of extremes, as if to say that only the extraordinary were worthy of seeking to climb it’s daunting peaks, to settle within its embrace, allowing nothing less. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Somewhere in between these whispers and murmurs, outside of the grasp of the mountains messengers and noteworthy settlers and passersby, lay Fiza. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Villagers side-eyed Fiza as they passed, swallowing their tongues and grinding their teeth in fear that something would be said to provoke them. They carried ineffective talismans and wove intricate tall tales, some were more than slanderous, others riddled with fantastical lies. Fiza lived their lives “alone”, moving in the space between here and there, a momentary existence, with constant conversation between them.
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    “Fiza is a djinn.”

                    <br>
                    
                    “They are a spirit, come to haunt the borders.” 
                    <br>
                    
                    “They guard the mountains.” 
                    
                    <br>

                    “Fiza—” began the old chief, with his long gray beard full of whorls like a storm cloud and deep set eyes of ochre, “—Is borne between the mountains and a woman.” He smiled as the children gasped, their curious eyes in so many shades of cool sky and sea and warm earth, were drawn to the looming range beyond the terrace. The sunlight peeking from between it’s crags trickled into their small circle of story and enraptured the normally excitable group.
                    <br>
                    “But isn’t Fiza, like…a lot of girls?” Questioned Wais, the hunters son, he could sing like birds. Even now his voice was tinged with the chirp of a sparrow. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    “Like the mountain has many peaks, Fiza has many faces. One woman and the range has made a woman with many faces. Just like how you, Wais, look like your father but have your mothers voice, Fiza looks like her mother, with her fathers characteristics…” He replied easily, stroking his beard with a thoughtful expression. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Wais contemplated then examined the other children with a critical eye to see if he could find their parents within their visage, contemplated some more, and finally sighed deeply, shaking his head. 
                    <br>
                    “I don’t get it…” 
                    <br>
                    The old man shrugged, his face lost in the wisps of his beard, shrunken and joyous. Wais frowned and wondered why he even mentioned Fiza in the first place if he was unwilling to elaborate. 
                    <br>
                    Later, when many summer dawns gave way to autumn dusks, and many preparations for oncoming frosts, Wais would be taught the bow by his father, whose dogs with their ghostly figures nipped at his heels to keep him in check if he lagged behind. His fingers bled from the drills, from constantly drawing the taut string back until he felt it would snap, whipping his face to scar. He stepped into the clearing, on the cusp of manhood, his eyes darting in every direction, searching for the deerlike creature he had followed into the meadows at the foot of the range. 
                    <br>
                    <em>Za, Za, Za, Za</em>
                    <br>
                    The din of cicadas and other insects crowded his ears, he took another step forward, then another, and another, until he heard it. 
                    <br>
                    <em>Chick, Crack!</em>
                    <br>
                    Like lightning, his arrow flew, straight through the brush, then a scream. 
                    <br>
                    <em>Aiyeeeee!</em>
                    <br>
                    He ran toward the noise, panicked, had he shot a person? Adrenaline flooded his body. He threw aside branches and leaves and skidded to a stop, shocked.
                    <br>
                    Before him, prone on the ground, weeping into her hands and bleeding into the ground from her abdomen, a young woman.
                     <br>
                    He hurriedly threw his satchel down and scrambled to help, she looked up at him and her eyes made him halt. Black as night, she seemed not in pain, but surprised, as if the arrow in her stomach didn’t faze her, but the shock of being hit had. Crystalline tears fell down her face, her lips quirked down. 
                    <br>
                    Wais, for a moment, thought he saw the stars falling from her eyes. Tears began to well up in his as well, to his discomfort, he fell to one knee before her, the weapons he’d used clattered onto the ground, his forehead knocking on his knee, he asked her with a shaking voice if there was anything he could do to right his wrong, for her to forgive him. 
                    <br>
                    She didn’t answer, her mouth opening and closing with no sound to accompany it. Nothing but tears, like rivers, and those didn’t make noise. She held her hands up to her face and opened her mouth, and though he could feel the scream in his chest he could not hear it. Soon enough the entire forest lapsed into uneasy silence, as deafening as a thunderclap. He looked around in wonder, and with no little fear. Her mouth clicked close after a long moment, and the world began again. 
                    <br>
                    <em> ssk, ssk </em>
                    <br>
                    His head snapped up, he reached, tentatively for his bow, but it seemed now, much further away from him. He scrambled. 
                    <br>
                    <em>Ssk, ssk, ssk</em>
                    <br>
                    Again, a haunting noise. Like a knife through flesh, something swept through the forest, closer to the two, inevitable as rain. 
                    <br>
                    He thought for a moment to leave, but knew he couldn’t leave the strange woman alone. She seemed unfazed by the eerie noise, she stared east, where it came from, wide as a lamb, still as death. 
                    <br>
                    <em>Hu, hu, hu</em>
                    <br>
                    She was still bleeding. Breathing heavily.
                    <br>
                    <em>Ssk, ssk, ssk.</em>
                    <br>
                    It sounded far closer than it should, whatever manner of monster it may be. His hand wrapped around the bow, he strung it back, crouched low to the ground by the woman. 
                    <br>
                    Leaves crunched, branches broke, the mountains loomed.
                    <br>
                    “Fiza,” He gasped, craning his neck. 
                    <br>
                    They blinked, slowly, eyes like a beetles carapace, black and gleaming, they slid down to his form. Their face, the one where it should be, formed expression as if it didn’t know how. Twisting like cloth, the same way one wrung linen before hanging it to dry.
                    <br>
                    Taller than the day, the crown of their head reached the middling branches of these impossibly old trees at the foot of the range. It would take four, no, five of him to reach the tip of their nose. A yellow scarf wrapped their head, cascading down their back and dragging across the forest floor like a flood of gold, from the neck down, rich damask of many colors, folded into itself, and from it’s folds he saw them. 
                    <br>
                    Faces. 
                    <br>
                    Women’s faces, girls, infants peering back at him curiously. As if he was the abnormality, not them. 
                    <br>
                    If the day had leaned even a whit toward dusk, he would’ve mistaken them for a horde of beasts, their eyes glittering behind the brush. 
                    <br>
                    <em>Hah, hah, hah</em>
                    <br>
                    The woman gasped wordlessly, she reached out toward Fiza, like a baby would their mother, relieved. Once Fiza’s many eyes seemed to have drawn away from his he released the breath he’d been holding. His heartbeat drummed away in his chest, he feared it would burst. 
                    <br>
                    Their towering form folded in half, then halved again, and again, until they seemed, to him, a more normal height. The length of cloth folded into itself like origami, the trail of golden fabric slowly reeled under their hem, throwing up dirt and leaves as it writhed. She approached, the faces in her folds fewer now, but vigilant, their eyes watching him as Fiza’s shrouded gaze stuck firmly to the injured woman’s wound. Two spindly arms emerged from within the folds, each finger bending, grasping, the use of their hands unfamiliar, their movement stilted. He made a move to stop them, but as soon as he stood, he fell, a presence making itself known, unseen, oppressive. 
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    “Kamala,” said Fiza, it could be no other. Their voice was strong, stable. It was the voice of a crone, it didn’t fit their ageless face. In Fiza’s voice he could hear the village’s elders, the midwives, the spinsters, and huntresses. A sharp stone rounded with the flow of time. For a moment he imagined his mother.
